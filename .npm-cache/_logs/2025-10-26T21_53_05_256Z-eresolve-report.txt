# npm resolution error report

While resolving: @0.0.1
Found: astro@5.15.1
node_modules/astro
  astro@"^5.15.1" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer astro@"^4.2.0" from @astrojs/vercel@7.8.2
node_modules/@astrojs/vercel
  dev @astrojs/vercel@"^7.6.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
